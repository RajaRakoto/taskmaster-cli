**Taskmaster AI** is an advanced artificial intelligence solution designed for task and project management, particularly in the field of software development. It acts as an orchestrator of AI agents, capable of maintaining long-term context and effectively managing complex, multi-step tasks. This helps prevent the context loss that often occurs with traditional AI tools during large-scale projects. Taskmaster AI automates the creation of Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), breaks down tasks, plans next steps, and guides AI agents to implement tasks in a coherent and organized manner. It supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc.) and offers a multi-role configuration (main, research, fallback) to optimize AI resource allocation based on project needs.

**Taskmaster CLI** was created to simplify and streamline the use of Taskmaster AI by providing an intuitive, interactive command-line interface. Instead of memorizing complex commands or navigating configuration files manually, users can easily manage AI agents, break down tasks, generate PRDs, and orchestrate project workflows step by stepâ€”all directly from the terminal. This tool makes Taskmaster AI more accessible and efficient for developers, allowing them to focus on their projects while the CLI handles the underlying complexity.

### ðŸ“Œ Build

When using the **build.js** file in this boilerplate, it's important to note the significance of the **target** option. By default, if the target option is not specified in the **build.js** file, it will be set to `browser`. However, for projects utilizing the `bun.js` runtime environment, it's imperative to explicitly set the target to `bun`. This guarantees compatibility with the `bun` shell environment and prevents unexpected behavior. Furthermore, it's noteworthy that the `target` supports three possible values: `browser`, `bun`, and `node`, providing flexibility in defining the build target according to specific project requirements.
